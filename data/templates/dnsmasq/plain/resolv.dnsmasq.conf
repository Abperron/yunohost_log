# This file will be used to generate /etc/resolv.dnsmasq.conf
# To avoid that every instance rely on the first server as primary
# server, this list is *shuffled* during every regen-conf of dnsmasq
# In the possibility where the first nameserver is down, dnsmasq
# will automatically switch to the next as primary server.
